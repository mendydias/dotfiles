# Mendy's Neovim Configuration

Welcome to my Neovim configuration! This setup is designed to enhance my coding workflow, and I'm happy to share it with the community. Feel free to use it, modify it, or suggest improvements. This configuration was heavily inspired by kickstart.nvim, and some parts of the config is directly yoinked from kickstart.nvim. Go check that project out, it's an amazing place to start your neovim journey.

## Features

- **Plugins**: Carefully selected plugins to support a productive development environment.
- **Key Mappings**: Customized key mappings to streamline common tasks.
- **Theme**: A visually appealing color scheme for code readability.
- **Settings**: Fine-tuned Neovim settings for a smooth and efficient experience.

All this in a scalable, easy-to-understand folder structure that you can customize and extend to fit your needs.
